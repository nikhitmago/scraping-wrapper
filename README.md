# scraping-wrapper

In this project, I was asked to build a wrapper program that extracts data from the course descriptions of UCLA that I crawled in the previously. Specifically, it should take a description page for a subject and extract the following information from the page, and then write to json files:

```
Subject: for example, “AEROSPACE STUDIES (AERO ST)”.
Course number & title: for example, “130A. Air Force Leadership Studies” 
Number of units: for example, “Units: 4”.
Course description: for example, “Lecture, three hours. ... P/NP or letter grading.”
```
