         "Course description": "Lecture, three hours; discussion, one hour. Archaeology is rapidly developing due to ongoing introduction of new hardware, software, and information dissemination technology. It is multidisciplinary field of study, combining its own research methods and technologies with elements from geology, history, ethnography, geography, material science, statistics, biology, biochemistry, medicine, and others, presenting opportunities not only to obtain new scholarly insights, but also to provide integrated instruction in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) skills. Use of archaeological data as paradigm in STEM education. Instant practical application of mathematics during surveying, geology during ceramic analysis or geophysical research, biochemistry during archaeological residue analysis, or biology during zooarchaeological or paleoethnobotanical research offers point of departure for instructors as well as motivation to students. P/NP or letter grading."
